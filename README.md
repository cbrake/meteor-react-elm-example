# Example of using Meteor, React, and Elm together

This project provides a simple example of how to
embed Elm components in a Meteor/React project.

To rebuild the elm code, run:

`npm run elmbuild`

To start the project, run:

- `npm install`
- `meteor`

The above assumes Meteor is already installed.
